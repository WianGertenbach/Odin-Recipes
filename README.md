# Odin-Recipes
This project demonstrates basic HTML skills learned as part of the Foundational Course. The project is a recipe website containing a home page with a list of recipes. Each item on the list directs the user to its own page with a detailed description of the recipe. 
The site has since been styled using CSS

Here is the link to the site: https://wiangertenbach.github.io/Odin-Recipes/
