            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups fresh pig’s blood (or dried blood, reconstituted)</li>
                <li>1 cup steel-cut oats</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons pork fat (or butter)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
                <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Natural sausage casings (optional, for traditional sausage form)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Stir in the oats and cook over low heat until soft, about 15-20 minutes. Let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
                <li>In a skillet, melt the pork fat or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the blood, cooked oats, sautéed onions, breadcrumbs, and all the spices (allspice, black pepper, salt, thyme, and marjoram). Mix thoroughly until well combined.</li>
                <li>If using natural casings, rinse them thoroughly and stuff them with the blood mixture using a sausage stuffer. Tie off the ends securely.</li>
                <li>If you prefer a loaf, pour the mixture into a greased loaf pan. Place the pan in a water bath (bain-marie) and bake in a preheated oven at 325°F (160°C) for about 1.5 hours. If using casings, simmer the sausages gently in water for about 30-40 minutes, ensuring they don't boil, which can cause them to burst.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, let the pudding cool slightly. Slice and fry in a little oil or butter until crispy on the outside. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
